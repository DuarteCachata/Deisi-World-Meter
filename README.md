The "DEISI World Meter" project aims to develop a Java application that is capable of receiving and responding to requests for information and statistics on a database of countries, cities and respective demographic data.Functions were implemented to validate data read from files. This includes checking whether a value is numeric, whether a country exists in the country list, and whether a country ID is valid. The project makes extensive use of classes and objects to represent entities such as countries, cities and populations. Additionally, polymorphism is used to return different types of objects based on an entity type parameter.
